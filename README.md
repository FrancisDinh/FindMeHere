# Whatsupp

Here I write about my learning journey.
I am a IT student, and I have background in Electrical Engineering. I have a passion in working with number, especially, in a energy management system. 
The idea sparked in my internship in 2016 at a paperfactory in Thailand, I was assigned a design task for a power switching system. I thought to myself "why dont we make it smarter", then I follow the idea, and step by step, I did what I am dreaming of. I have been learning software engineering and AI to enlarge my knowledge and better my skills. Here are some projects that I am sharing:
# [Energy demand forecasting](https://github.com/FrancisDinh/Energy-forecasting-in-EMSs)
Continue to realize a real-life scenario of a energy management system, where it has a demand forecasting module.
