# Whatsupp

Here I write about my learning journey.
I am a IT student, and I have background in Electrical Engineering. I have a passion in working with number, especially, in a energy management system. 
The idea sparked in my internship in 2016 at a paperfactory in Thailand, I was assigned a design task for a power switching system. I thought to myself "why dont we make it smarter", then I follow the idea, and step by step, I did what I am dreaming of. I have been learning software engineering and AI to enlarge my knowledge and better my skills. Here are some projects that I am sharing:
# [Energy demand forecasting](https://github.com/FrancisDinh/Energy-forecasting-in-EMSs)
Continue to realize a real-life scenario of a energy management system, where it has a demand forecasting module.

# [Energy management system (EMS)](https://github.com/FrancisDinh/Smart-Energy-Project)

# [Smart office with AI planning](https://github.com/FrancisDinh/Smart-Office-with-Pi)
With the emergence of IoT in every corner of the modern life, the communication
between devices plays an important role in transforming a traditional building
to a smart building, which can operate stably standalone and interact with
human and environment. According to Green Building Council Australia (2013),
a smart commercial building consumes 66% less electricity and produces 62%
fewer greenhouse gas than a traditional one.

The heart of a smart building is data, which is harvested via sensors and end
devices, then transferred to the solution by utilizing devices to satisfy specific
constraints. The goal of this project is to design and implement a smart office
using a Raspberry Pi manipulating a lighting system, air conditioner, and a door
via a relays with the information from Grove Pi sensors. The model shall optimize
energy efficiency and ensure the safety, privacy, comfort of its occupants.
